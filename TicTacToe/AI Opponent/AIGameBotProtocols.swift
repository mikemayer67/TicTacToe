// The class used by the AIGameBot to define a move made by a player must conform
//   to the AIGameMove protoccol.  This protocol requires a single variable (aiGameValue)
//   which is used internally by the gamebot.  The value should not be modified by
//   anything other than the gamebot. The game model will dictate what additional
//   methods and attributes the move class should have in order to progress the game
//   state.

// The class used by the AIGameBot to model the game state must conform to
//   the AIGameModel protocol.  Unlike the AIGamePlayer and AIGameMove protocols,
//   the gamebot requires a number of methods and properties to be defined by the
//   game model.

  //  The method should return a tuple that reflects if the outcome of the move:
  //  - the cone attribute indicates whether the move completes the game (win or tie)
  //  - the value attribute reflects the value of the move FOR THE PLAYER MAKING THE MOVE
  //  The returned value of Int.max should only be used in case of a win for the player
  //  The returned value of Int.min should only be used in case of a loss for the player
